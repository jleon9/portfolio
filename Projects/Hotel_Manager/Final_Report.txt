Final Project Report:

I have been able to complete the Room and Reservation modules successfully, having passed all the tests on CodePost
and those from the PDF examples.

I have passed all the tests in the Hotel module except for load_hotel. The load_hotel method gave me
the right information except the reservation dates that were incorrect.

Since the Booking module relies on the load_hotel method, I have not been able to do it.
